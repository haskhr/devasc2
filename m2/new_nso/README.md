# Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) New Sandbox
Cisco DevNet added a new NSO sandbox directly to DevNet, which is easier
to use than the dCloud version. This demo is an update to the course
demonstrating that new NSO sandbox.

Also newly added are the NSO Swagger-style API docs:
`https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!cisco-nso-swagger-api-docs`

The ARP tables for `dist-rtr01` and `dist-rtr02` are included in the
`data_ref/` directory for easy reference and viewing. I've also
included a sample `arp_stats.csv` file, which is the script's output.
